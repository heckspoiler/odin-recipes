        <p>Cucumber Water is beneficiary for you. If you dont believe me, just look at my face.<br> <img src="/Users/Carlito/Desktop/repos/odin-recipes/recipes/vegan/pictures/uglyface.png" alt="cute little face" width="120px" height="100px">

        Cucumber Water helped me get in shape. Four years ago I slept at least 19 hours a day, and when I was awake I did nothing but go to McDonalds. There I would eat the whole menu, sometimes even twice, and then I would go back

        Don't get me wrong, I still go to MikD every day and eat a shitton of delicous burgers. But now I only sleep for 16 hours. If I can do it, certainly you can, too!</p>
